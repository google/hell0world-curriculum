# Circuit Playground Course Plan

NOTE to Editors of this Doc: 
Since this plan largely just links in to the Code.org site, and it's quite likely the contents and location of those sections will change, it's important to provide a short, identifying description here with each link, so that future teachers can more easily adjust to those changes.

   *Comments on the section.*.  

### 5. Dynamic lights with function input.

Base the addresses on function input and use to rotate with button press.

## Part 4: Loops and Timed Loops

TODO(yozhipozhi)

### 1. Quick review of for loops.

### 2. Quick discussion of timed loops.

### 3. Apply dynamic lights to timed loops.

## Part 5: Sensor Input

### 1. Discuss event handling vs. polling.

* Polling: Khan academy/Processing style: mouseX
* Events: Event handlers here
* Mix of both: Slider: Event told us changed; then we poll it to get value.
* Looking ahead: Buttons (events) vs. Light sensor (polling)
