# Circuit Playground

In this unit we adapt Code.org curricula to teach some basic programmming of
physical devices using Javascript.

We follow much of the [Physical Computing Unit](https://studio.code.org/s/csd6/) of the [Code.org Computer Science Discoveries course](https://studio.code.org/courses/csd),
which uses the [AdaFruit Circuit Playground](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/overview) integrated microcontroller board (see Hardware Details below).

## Hardware Details

We use [Circuit Playground Classic](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3000) devices, which come pre-installed with the [Firmata firmware](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) required to use Code.org with the Circuit Playground.
